hasm - hack (virtual computer) assembler

Usage: hasm infile [-o outfile]
Assembles 'infile' and creates an ASCII-encoded hack binary 'infile.hack'.
Specifications can be seen in chapter 6 section 2 of the book "The Elements of Computing Systems" by N. Nisan and S. Shocken. They are all satisfied.

Regarding the implementaiton details in chapter 6 section 3, none of them were followed, because I'm stubborn and did it my way.

Options:
    -o outfile      specify output file
