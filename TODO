TODO
- better logging for tests
- symbol support
- Count current character in current line (for better error messages)
- Use hashmap for symbol_pairs, comp_codes, jump_codes, and dest_codes.
Make sure to pre-hash the string values and store items at respective indexes.
- Free memory on fatal errors before exiting.
- Move string functions into separate file
- Make parse_arguments more general to handle declarative argument assignment (and
add options for logging)
