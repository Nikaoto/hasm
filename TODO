TODO
- update readme to include more info
- make bench (luajit script that times compilation)
- bound checks when skipping blankspace in parsing functions
- Use hashmap for symbol_pairs, comp_codes, jump_codes, and dest_codes.
Make sure to pre-hash the string values and store items at respective indexes.
- Free memory on fatal errors before exiting.
- Move string functions into separate file
- Make parse_arguments more general to handle declarative argument assignment (and
add options for logging)
- allow label declarations without parentheses and with a colon. Ex: 'THIS_IS_A_LABEL: @LOOP'
- report unused labels as warning?
